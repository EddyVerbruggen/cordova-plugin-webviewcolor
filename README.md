> **Non-PhoneGap Build users, please read this!**

> On PhoneGap Build it is not possible to specify the webview background color (hence this plugin), but on local build, you can.
> Just change this line in MainViewController.m to anything you like: theWebView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
> For example:     theWebView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];

## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to change the background color of the iOS WebView.
Created because I can't read the contents of the native `<select>` picker (see screenshots below).

* Compatible with PhoneGap 3.0.0 and up.
* Tested on iOS 6.1 and 7.0. Probably works on lower versions, but it's mostly useful for iOS7 anyway.
* Supports all colors, just pass a valid hex value like #FF0000.
* Compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).
* Pending official support by [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins).

## 2. Installation

### Automatically (CLI / Plugman)
WebViewColor is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman), compatible with [PhoneGap 3.0 CLI](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.0.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface_add_features), here's how it works with the CLI:

```
$ phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/iOSWebViewColor-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
```
or
```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/iOSWebViewColor-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
```
run this command afterwards:
```
$ cordova prepare
```

WebViewColor.js is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.

### Manually

1\. Add the following xml to your `config.xml` in the root directory of your `www` folder:
```xml
<feature name="WebViewColor">
	<param name="ios-package" value="WebViewColor" />
</feature>
```

2\. Grab a copy of WebViewColor.js, add it to your project and reference it in `index.html`:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/WebViewColor.js"></script>
```

3\. Download the source files and copy them to your project.

Copy `WebViewColor.h` and `WebViewColor.h` to `platforms/ios/<ProjectName>/Plugins`

### PhoneGap Build

WebViewColor will soon work with PhoneGap build too!
Just add the following xml to your `config.xml` to always use the latest version of this plugin:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.ioswebviewcolor" />
```
or to use this exact version:
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.ioswebviewcolor" version="1.1" />
```

The required javascript file is brought in automatically. There is no need to change or add anything in your html.


## 3. Usage
You can change the background color immediately after `ondeviceready`, but you may also want to do it by, for instance, a click of a button:
```html
  <button onclick="window.plugins.webviewcolor.change('#FF0000')">change to #FF0000</button>
  <button onclick="window.plugins.webviewcolor.change('#00FF00', function(){alert('color was changed!')})">change to #00FF00</button>
```
.change() has three argument
* A valid hex color, formatted like: #FF00FF (including the #).
* (optional) successcallback, so you know when the color has been changed.
* (optional) errorcallback, but this is never called, since changing the color technically never fails. If the passed color is not valid, the color is simply not changed, but the successcallback is invoked. I didn't find an easy way to change this behaviour, but it shouldn't hurt anyone. I've added the errorcallback argument for possible future compatibility.


## 4. Testing
The background color change can best be seen by allowing overscroll (rubber banding), so when you swipe up and down, the WebView background is shown.

Another possibility is adding a `<select>` or `<input type="date">`.
When clicked, the background color shines through the native picker UI.
